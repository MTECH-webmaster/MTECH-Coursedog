```

#### Coursedog Program ID
When there is no Program ID value set, the plugin queries the API by search, using the program's name as the query.
```
http://api/v1/cm/schoolId/programs/search/searchQuery
```
When a Program ID value is set, the plugin will query the API for a program with that exact ID.
```
http://api/v1/cm/schoolId/programs/programId
```
Program ID values can be found by querying the Coursedog Curriculum API for all programs.
```
http://api/v1/cm/schoolId/programs?limit=50
```
